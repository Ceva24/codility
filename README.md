Solutions for some of the Codility challenges.

Introduction
------------

This repo stores my personal attempts at some of the [Codility](http://www.codility.com) challenges. All of these challenges are publicly available on the Codility website at [http://codility.com/train/](http://codility.com/train/).

Every solution was attempted within a 30 minute time limit, and  the code has not been cleaned up after submission. In cases where I was unhappy with the result, there's a separate file with an improved submission.
